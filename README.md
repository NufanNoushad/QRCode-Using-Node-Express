This was a QR Code generator web app I built two years ago during my Backend foundational course I did.

This is a simple web application built with **Node.js and Express.js framework** that allows users to generate QR codes from text input. 

**Outlining installation requirements:**

**Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/QRCodeGenerator.git

**Navigate to the Project Directory:**
cd QRCodeGenerator

**Install dependencies**
npm install

**Run the app**
node app.js

**To access the application:**
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

**To generate QR Codes:**
Visit the home page to enter text.
Submit the form to generate a QR code.
View the generated QR code on the 'scan' page.
